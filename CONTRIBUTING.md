# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing!

## Guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Prefer Windows-compatible solutions (this project targets TeamTalk on Windows).
- Do not commit secrets or local profiles (`profiles/`, `channel_profiles/` are ignored).
- Do not commit TeamTalk SDK files (`TeamTalk_DLL/` and `TeamTalkPy/` are ignored).

## Development

- Python 3.8+ is supported.
- Run a quick syntax check:

```bash
python -m compileall -q .
```
